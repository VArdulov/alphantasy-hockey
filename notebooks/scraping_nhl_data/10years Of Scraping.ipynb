    "# Collecting All of the Data\n",
    "**By: Victor Ardulov**\n",
    "\n",
    "So in `alphantasy-hockey/fantasy/scrapping` there is a module that automates a lot of what we saw in [Exploring NHL&reg; Scrapter](./Exploring_NHL_Scraper.ipynb). Importantly there is this function `scrape_game` for which the \"help\" is outlined below. The point is here I am writing some code to actually collect all of the historical data for the last 10 (2009/10 - 2019/20 seasons) and saving the game_reports in to JSON dictionaries \"locally\" my rough back-of the envolope math says that the JSON files should be approximately 100KB each means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 100\\text{kB} \\times (\\frac{82 \\times31}{2}) \\times 10 \\approx 1.27 \\text{GB} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So I've also added the `.json` extension to the `.gitignore` but the data will be stored in the top-level directory [nhl-data](../../nhl-data) organized by a subfolder for the season and then a file `game_report_****.json`. This folder can then be used and indexed by something ElasticSearch which may make it a little easier construct records. The alternative is to reorganize the game reports to be lists of player specific dictionaries, but I'm not sure so I'll probably end up consulting my resident ElasticSearch and Kibana experts."
